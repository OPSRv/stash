# stash-separator

Out-of-process Python sidecar for the Stash app. Runs Meta's [Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs) for music source separation and [BeatNet](https://github.com/mjhydri/BeatNet) for tempo detection.

This package is **not part of the macOS `.app` bundle**. It is built once per release on `macos-14` (Apple Silicon) by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, code-signed, notarized, packaged as a tarball, and uploaded as a release asset. The Stash app downloads it lazily on user opt-in into `$APPLOCALDATA/separator/`.

The same out-of-process layout that `crates/stash-diarize/` uses for diarization, but with a Python toolchain instead of Rust because Demucs and BeatNet are Python-only.

## Hosting the tarball somewhere other than the stash GitHub release

The default download URL is `https://github.com/OPSRv/stash/releases/latest/download/stash-separator-macos-arm64.tar.gz`, which couples the sidecar's lifetime to your app release tags — every new tag re-publishes it. If you'd rather host the tarball on a stable mirror (HuggingFace dataset, Cloudflare R2, S3, plain object storage), set `STASH_SEPARATOR_URL` at app build time and the catalog picks it up via `option_env!`:

```sh
# Example: HuggingFace dataset, public, free, ~50 GB cap.
STASH_SEPARATOR_URL='https://huggingface.co/<user>/stash-separator/resolve/main' \
  npm run tauri build
```

The catalog appends `/<filename>` to whatever you provide, so the resolved URL becomes `<base>/stash-separator-macos-arm64.tar.gz`. HTTPS only — the in-app downloader refuses other schemes as a defensive guard.

You still have to upload the tarball to your chosen host yourself; the build step that produces `dist/stash-separator/` is unchanged.

## Layout

- `src/main.py` — CLI entry (`--mode analyze | separate | bpm`)
- `requirements.txt` — Python pins (demucs, BeatNet, torch, soundfile)
- `stash-separator.spec` — PyInstaller `--onedir` spec
- `build.sh` — local build helper

## Local build

```sh
./build.sh
```

Produces `dist/stash-separator/` with the binary + bundled libs. Copy that directory to `~/Library/Application Support/com.stash.popup/separator/bin/` to test the running Stash app against your local build.

## CLI

```sh
stash-separator --mode analyze \
                --input song.mp3 \
                --out-dir ./stems \
                --model htdemucs_6s \
                --device auto
```

Writes a single JSON line to stdout on completion:

```json
{
  "stems_dir": "./stems",
  "stems": {
    "vocals":  "./stems/vocals.wav",
    "drums":   "./stems/drums.wav",
    "bass":    "./stems/bass.wav",
    "guitar":  "./stems/guitar.wav",
    "piano":   "./stems/piano.wav",
    "other":   "./stems/other.wav"
  },
  "bpm": 128.4,
  "beats": [0.21, 0.68, 1.15, 1.62, ...],
  "duration_sec": 240.5,
  "model": "htdemucs_6s",
  "device": "mps"
}
```

Progress is written to stderr as `progress\t<0..1>\t<phase>` lines. On failure the binary still exits 0 with `{"error":"..."}` — the parent never has to interpret an exit code (same contract as `stash-diarize`).

## Output filenames

| Model         | Stems |
|---------------|-------|
| `htdemucs_6s` (default) | `vocals`, `drums`, `bass`, **`guitar`**, `piano`, `other` |
| `htdemucs` / `htdemucs_ft` | `vocals`, `drums`, `bass`, `other` |

Use `--stems vocals,drums` to keep only a subset.

## BPM

`--mode analyze` runs BeatNet on the **drums** stem after separation finishes. Beat tracking is noticeably more confident on a clean percussion signal than on a full mix.

`--mode bpm` runs BeatNet directly on the input file (no separation). Faster, slightly less reliable on busy mixes.

## Models

Demucs caches models under `$TORCH_HOME/hub/`. The Stash app sets `TORCH_HOME=$APPLOCALDATA/separator/models/` via `--models-dir` so weights live under the app data dir, not `~/.cache/torch/hub`.
